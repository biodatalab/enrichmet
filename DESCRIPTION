Description: Provides functions to perform metabolite-based pathway enrichment 
    analysis using Fisher’s exact test and MetSEA. Computes relative betweenness 
    centrality (RBC) of input metabolites in a pathway-metabolite interaction network. 
    The package generates visualizations including pathway dot plots, MetSEA plots, 
    metabolite centrality plots, and network plots. It supports KEGG-based pathway inputs and 
    generates exportable results.
