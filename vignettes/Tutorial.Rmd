# Introduction

Advances in metabolomics have enhanced our understanding of cellular processes by enabling the detection of hundreds of metabolites in a single experiment, offering insights into complex metabolic networks. Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA) is key to linking these metabolites to biological pathways, but existing tools often require multiple steps, lack robust visualization, depend on web-based interfaces, or rely on difficult to install R packages—hindering reproducibility and efficiency. To address these challenges, we present EnrichMet, an R package for streamlined, reproducible pathway enrichment, metabolite set enrichment analysis (MetSEA), and network analysis. EnrichMet integrates fgsea for fast MetSEA, igraph for topology-based metrics, and curated KEGG data for enrichment using Fisher’s Exact Test—all accessible via a single function call. Through a case study on experimental metabolomics data, we show that EnrichMet outperforms existing tools in accuracy, speed, and usability. Its flexible framework also supports diverse data types and applications beyond KEGG, empowering researchers to extract deeper biological insights with minimal effort.


**EnrichMet** generates a rich set of visualizations, including:

- **Pathway enrichment plot**
- **Pathway impact plot**
- **MetSEA plot**
- **RBC plot**
- **Network graph**
- **Pathway heatmap**
- **Pathway membership plot**
- **Interaction network plot**

Additionally, EnrichMet exports both the **MetSEA** and **pathway enrichment** results as `.xlsx` tables, streamlining both analysis and reporting.


# Installation

You can install EnrichMet as:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_git("https://github.com/biodatalab/enrichmet.git")
# or 
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/biodatalab/enrichmet.git")
# or
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("enrichmet")

```

## Required Input Files

To run the **EnrichMet** package, you need to provide at least the following three files:

- **`PathwayVsMetabolites`**  
This file defines the mapping between metabolic pathways and their associated metabolites, serving as the background reference for Fisher’s exact test–based enrichment analysis.
EnrichMet uses curated human-specific pathway-metabolite mappings, which are periodically updated using KEGGREST and archived on Zenodo to ensure reproducibility and minimize run-time delays. 
  We provide a human-specific `PathwayVsMetabolites` file available here:  
  [Human-PathwaysVsMetabolites.csv](https://zenodo.org/api/records/15498097/files/Human-PathwaysVsMetabolites.csv)  
  However, users can supply a file tailored to their species of interest.

- **`InputMetabolites`**  
  A list of metabolites from your experimental data to analyze, typically consisting of metabolite identifiers detected or quantified in your study. This input file should be prepared and provided by the user.

- **`SummaryStatistics`**  
  Statistical results corresponding to the input metabolites, such as fold changes, p-values, or other relevant metrics. These statistics guide the enrichment analysis by reflecting the significance or effect size of each metabolite. This file is also user-provided.This information can be supplied as a separate data frame or retrieved directly from rowData() in a SummarizedExperiment object, assuming it contains columns for metabolite identifiers, p-values, and fold changes.

## Optional Input Files

Including these optional files can enhance the analysis and its biological interpretation:

- **`KEGGLookup`**  
  A reference file linking KEGG compound IDs to metabolite names or other annotations, which helps standardize identifiers and improve pathway mapping.  
  We provide a KEGGLookup file here:  
  [kegg_lookup.xlsx](https://zenodo.org/api/records/15498097/files/kegg_lookup.xlsx)  
  Users may also provide a lookup file specific to their species.

- **`STITCHInteractions`**  
  A dataset of known or predicted interactions between metabolites or proteins, useful for constructing interaction networks to support pathway analysis.  
  We supply an example file here:  
  [chemical_chemical.tsv](https://zenodo.org/api/records/15498097/files/chemical_chemical.tsv)  
  Users may provide their own interaction data appropriate for their species.

- **`mapping_df`**  
  A mapping data frame that links STITCH identifiers with metabolite names, facilitating integration between datasets.  
  The provided example file is available here:  
  [mapping_df.xlsx](https://zenodo.org/api/records/15498097/files/mapping_df.xlsx)  
  Users can substitute this with a mapping file relevant to their species of interest.


## Case study of KrasG12D mutation

We used summary statistics from differential analyses based on metabolomic measurements comparing KrasG12D mutations with and without TAp73 deletion. The top 50 metabolites, ranked by significance, were selected for pathway enrichment analysis using Fisher’s Exact Test. These summary statistics were also utilized for MetSEA analysis.
